        "Highlights\n",
        "Frequently mentioned facilitators were access, convenience, population health, mobile technology care, and self-efficacy.\n",
        "Frequently mentioned barriers were the increased cost to providers, patient privacy, technical literacy, state licensing, and data security.\n",
        "Health policies can increase access, improve population health, and remove constraints to reach patients in developing countries.\n",
        "Abstract\n",
        "Background\n",
        "Telemedicine diagnoses and treats patients remotely via telecommunications technology all over the world. Telemedicine becomes more prevalent as providers recognize the benefits, patients receive increased access and payers see the reduction in cost of care.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective\n",
        "Telemedicine studies have shown success in limiting geographical constraints, time spent, and costs incurred by patients with positive health outcomes across medical specialties. The aim of this review is to evaluate the implications of telemedicine and health policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods\n",
        "An assessment of the literature in four databases was made on content germane to health policy implications of telemedicine. From the results of the search, 48 publications were kept for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Results\n",
        "The fifteen facilitators mentioned most often were increased access, increased convenience, improved population health, care enabled through mobile technology, self-efficacy, increased patient-to-provider communication, cost advantages, efficacy of modality, increased health outcomes, reaches developing countries, increased quality, a positive previous experience, and a secure means of care. The twelve barriers mentioned most often were the increased cost to providers, patient privacy, technical literacy, state licensing, data security, socioeconomics, limited reimbursements, issues of interoperability, patient safety, less personal means of care, misaligned incentives, and ethical concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusions\n",
        "Telemedicine has the potential for growth and adoption, however, there are several implications and barriers of health policy surrounding telemedicine that make it difficult to adopt. Policies will likely encourage and incentivize its spread and use. Future research should focus on standardization of telemedicine and new policies and incentives that encourage its use.\n",

              "'Telemedicine and health policy: A systematic reviewHighlightsFrequently mentioned facilitators were access, convenience, population health, mobile technology care, and self-efficacy.Frequently mentioned barriers were the increased cost to providers, patient privacy, technical literacy, state licensing, and data security.Health policies can increase access, improve population health, and remove constraints to reach patients in developing countries.AbstractBackgroundTelemedicine diagnoses and treats patients remotely via telecommunications technology all over the world. Telemedicine becomes more prevalent as providers recognize the benefits, patients receive increased access and payers see the reduction in cost of care.ObjectiveTelemedicine studies have shown success in limiting geographical constraints, time spent, and costs incurred by patients with positive health outcomes across medical specialties. The aim of this review is to evaluate the implications of telemedicine and health policies.MethodsAn assessment of the literature in four databases was made on content germane to health policy implications of telemedicine. From the results of the search, 48 publications were kept for analysis.ResultsThe fifteen facilitators mentioned most often were increased access, increased convenience, improved population health, care enabled through mobile technology, self-efficacy, increased patient-to-provider communication, cost advantages, efficacy of modality, increased health outcomes, reaches developing countries, increased quality, a positive previous experience, and a secure means of care. The twelve barriers mentioned most often were the increased cost to providers, patient privacy, technical literacy, state licensing, data security, socioeconomics, limited reimbursements, issues of interoperability, patient safety, less personal means of care, misaligned incentives, and ethical concerns.ConclusionsTelemedicine has the potential for growth and adoption, however, there are several implications and barriers of health policy surrounding telemedicine that make it difficult to adopt. Policies will likely encourage and incentivize its spread and use. Future research should focus on standardization of telemedicine and new policies and incentives that encourage its use.'"

              "'Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.  Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.  Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg. Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).  Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.   In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1). Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure. Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder. Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination. Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma. This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.   Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired. Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts. Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%). Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens. This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris. Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins. In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open.  (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon. Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases. It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.  Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported. The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern. Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.  Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.   Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber. The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage. Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected. It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity. Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations. A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).  The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment. Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective. Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg. However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements. With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea. Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1). Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.  Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic. In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent. Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle. Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.  Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.  Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP. It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur. Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3). In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.   These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids. Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG. The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.  “Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been\\xa0 associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.\\xa0\\xa0This is\\xa0evident in activities\\xa0requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility. Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.  Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression. It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value. A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.  Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations. Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire. The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery. Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen. In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision. This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure. Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block. In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart. This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol. Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided. Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression. Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically. Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved. It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.  If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added. If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.   Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents. Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence. It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.  Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure. Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour. It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.  There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches. In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms. Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes. Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action. Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%. Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis. Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field. An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.  Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste. Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist. It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.  Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%. Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow. It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy. Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.  Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system. Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure. Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use. Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa. Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil. Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness. Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma. Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.  Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors). The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents. The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes. All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable. Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma. Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations. It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance. Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.  Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.  Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product. With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow. Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC. The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects. Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect. The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies. General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma. Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation. The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression. Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma. Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.  Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.      '"

cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been\\xa0 associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is\\xa0evident in activities\\xa0requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.'"

Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).  Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.

            "Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens. This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris. Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.\n",
            "Max source length: 124\n",
            "In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open.  (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon. Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases. It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.  Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported. The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern. Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.  Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.   Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber. The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage. Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected. It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity. Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations. A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).  The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment. Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective. Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg. However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.\n",
            "Max source length: 538\n",
            "With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea. Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1). Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.  Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic. In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent. Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle. Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.  Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.  Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP. It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur. Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3). In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.   These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids. Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.\n",

            "The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.  “Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.  This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility. Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.  Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression. It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value. A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.  Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations. Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire. The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery. Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen. In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision. This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure. Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block. In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart. This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol. Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.\n",

            "Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression. Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically. Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved. It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.  If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added. If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.   Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents. Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence. It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.  Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.\n",

            "Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour. It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.  There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches. In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms. Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.\n",

            "Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action. Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%. Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis. Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field. An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.  Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.\n",

            "Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist. It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.  Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%. Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow. It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy. Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.  Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system. Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure. Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.\n",

            "Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa. Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil. Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.\n",

            "Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma. Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.  Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors). The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents. The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes. All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.\n",
            "Max source length: 251\n",
            "Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma. Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations. It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance. Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.  Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.  Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.\n",

            "With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow. Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC. The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects. Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect. The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.\n",

            "General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma. Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation. The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression. Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma. Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.  Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.      \n",

            "Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open.\n",
            "(Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.\n"

pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.'"

              "'Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open. (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the

failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.\n",

            "LSA : Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open. (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the

reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.\n",

            "edmundson : Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open. (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide)

which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.\n",

            "lex-rank : Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open. (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives

20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.\n",

            "reduction : Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open. (Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been  associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is evident in activities requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to

              "'Glaucoma is a mixed group of eye disorders sharing common  features which typically includes optic disc cupping and visual  field loss, thereby more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy.Optic nerve damage results in progressive retinal ganglionic  cell loss and irreversible blindness, if not treated.Traditionally,  glaucoma has been characterized by the existence of raised  intraocular pressure (IOP), however nerve damage may occur in the  presence of values within the statistically normal range between   8–21 mmHg.Glaucomatous disc and field changes in the absence  of elevated pressure constitutes normal or low tension glaucoma  (LTG).Similarly, conditions exceeding the upper limit of 21 mmHg  may not be associated with signs of visual field loss or optic disc  damage and comprises ocular hypertension.In addition to optic  neuropathy, the two main types of glaucoma (open angle and  closed angle) are described on the appearance of the drainage  system within the eye, including associated increase in the IOP  (Figure 1).Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.The main characteristic features include optic disc cupping, visual field  loss, and in most instances a raised intraocular pressure.Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for nearly two thirds of all cases, while  angle closure glaucoma contributes the majority of the remainder.Screening for glaucoma is not cost-effective, and diagnosis of the  primary open angle type is usually an incidental finding during ophthalmological examination.Various treatment options, including  medical and surgical interventions are accessible in the management of glaucoma.This article contains a brief description on the  pathophysiology and focuses on the pharmacological options available in the treatment of glaucoma.Keywords:  Glaucoma, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta antagonists, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, cholinergic  agonists Both types can be further divided into primary versus secondary,  and congenital versus acquired.Glaucoma has a global prevalence  of 3.54% in those aged between 40 and 80 years, and is the  second leading cause of irreversible blindness, only superseded  by cataracts.Open angle glaucoma is the highest in Africa (4.2%),  while closed angle glaucoma is more prevalent in Asia (1.09%).Aqueous humour (a transparent, low protein containing fluid) is  continuously secreted by the ciliary epithelium providing structural  support to the lens.This watery fluid is present in both the anterior  and posterior chambers of the eye and drains through a sieve-like  trabecular meshwork located in the angle between the cornea  and the iris.Final drainage out of the eye occurs via the canal of  Schlemm  into the episcleral vein or intrascleral venous plexus  terminating in the ocular veins.In open angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork undergoes  morphological changes over time, resulting in progressive  impairment of drainage although it remains anatomically open.(Figure 1) Open angle glaucoma most often affects both eyes,  but asymmetric involvement is not uncommon.Primary open  angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type and accounts  for 74% of all glaucoma cases.It is estimated that 57.5 million  people (3.05%) worldwide suffer from POAG.Prevalence among  Black populations is the highest, with 2.1% at age 40 and 12.2% at  age 80 being reported.The incidence in Asian populations (0.8%  at age 40 and 4.3% at age 80), and Caucasians (0.4% at 40 years  and 5.3% at 80 years) suggests an ethno-genetic disease pattern.Although the exact cause of POAG remains unknown, more than  fifty risk factors and secondary causes have been identified.Some of these include diabetes mellitus, migraine headache,  cardiovascular disease, asthma or COPD (inhaled anticholinergics  and glucocorticosteroids), myopia, advanced age and a family  history of first-degree relatives with the same condition.Disease  progression leads to the formation of scar tissue between the iris  and trabecular meshwork and will ultimately result in closing off  the anterior chamber.The consequent rise in IOP is transmitted to  the optic disc and is eventually responsible for atrophy and nerve  fiber damage.Owing to the slow progression of the disease, POAG  remains asymptomatic until central vision is affected.It does not  present with headache, eye pain or loss of visual acuity.Diagnosis  is usually incidental during routine funduscopic or optometry  examinations.A cup : disc ratio of 0.6 (glaucomatous cupping), and  central corneal thickness in the presence of risk factors is suggestive  of glaucoma, and requires ophthalmological referral (Figure 2).The progression from POAG to Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma  (CACG), requires lifelong treatment.Official general population screening policies do not exist and are  not cost-effective.Measuring IOP has a sensitivity of only 47.1%,  implying that nearly half of patients with POAG will have IOP below  22 mmHg.However, patients with risk factors are encouraged to  undergo annual ophthalmological examinations and additional  IOP measurements.With closed angle glaucoma, a primary hypermetropic anatomical  defect (such as weakened ciliary muscles, naturally small eyes,  narrow angle or thick lens) in the absence of an identifiable  secondary cause, results in the pupil compressing the drainage  canal between the iris and cornea.Compression and narrowing of  the canal reduces or obstructs the outflow of aqueous humour in  passing through the pupil, therefore accumulating in the anterior  chamber (Figure 1).Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is  less common than POAG and accounts for approximately a third  of all cases, with a global incidence of 0.5%.Symptoms of closed  angle glaucoma depend on the degree of angle closure and in  some instances may resolve spontaneously; in which case it may  become chronic.In established disease, vision loss is severe and  permanent.Secondary causes of angle-closure glaucoma include  masses or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball or  the presence of a fibrovascular membrane (neovascular glaucoma)  over the anterior chamber angle.Risk factors for angle closure  glaucoma include older age (> 60 years), female gender, Asian  ethnicity, hyperopia and a positive family history.Attacks occur  more frequently at night when diminished light cause mydriasis and  narrowing of the angle.Unexpected closure (acute angle closure  glaucoma, AACG) of the anterior chamber angle due to pupillary  block may result in a sudden rise in IOP.It constitutes a medical  emergency, since permanent blindness and irreversible damage  to the optic nerve may occur.Acute attacks are characterized  by intermittent symptoms such as severe eye pain, nausea and  vomiting, loss of vision, halos around lights, unilateral red tearing  eye, oval shaped non-reactive pupil, a cloudy cornea and the loss  of red reflex (Figure 3).In addition, it is estimated that prescribed, or over-the-counter  pharmacological agents are responsible for at least 30% of acute  angle closure glaucoma.These include antihistamines, cholinergic-  and anticholinergic agents, adrenergic agents, antidepressants,  sulphonamides, anticoagulants and glucocorticosteroids.Table 1  below summarises the mechanism responsible for causing AACG.The goal in treating POAG is to establish and maintain the intra- ocular pressure at a range where visual field loss will have the  least negative impact on the patient’s perceived visual disability.“Various studies have shown that visual field loss in glaucoma has  been\\xa0 associated with a significant decrease in a person’s vision- related quality of life.This is\\xa0evident in activities\\xa0requiring optimal  vision, such as dark adaptation, avoiding unintentional bumping  into objects and outdoor mobility.Determining the target  intraocular pressure needs to be individualised for each patient,  since the measured pressure at diagnosis could be within the normal  range of 8 to 21 mmHg in 30–50% of patients.Aiming for pressures  within these ranges will contribute towards optic nerve damage  and further progression.It is generally accepted that patients with  early disease benefit from a reduction of at least 20% in the baseline  value.A reduction of 30% is recommended in individuals with  more advanced features of POAG.Target IOP should continuously  be re-calculated during monitoring and follow-up assessment  of visual fields and disc and nerve fiber examinations.Reducing  the IOP, however, does not guarantee that progression will not  transpire.The choice of therapy depends on the relative risks and  benefits of available modalities, which include pharmacological  treatment, laser therapy or incisional surgery.Factors such as cost,  dosing, patient’s age, the presence of comorbidities (asthma or  COPD), pregnancy, adherence to treatment and the degree of optic  disc damage should be considered in choosing an appropriate  treatment regimen.In treating AACG, the primary goal is to make the correct diagnosis to  prevent permanent loss of vision.This is achieved by rapid lowering  of the IOP and reversal of the angle closure.Empiric treatment with  topical and systemic aqueous humour suppressants (β blockers  and acetazolamide) reduces the IOP, followed by pilocarpine to  reverse the pupil block.In the absence of available trials comparing  medical options for treatment of AACG, the initial management  usually consists of administering one drop of 0.5% timolol,   1% apraclonidine and 2% pilocarpine one minute apart.This is  followed by intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol.Eye pressure  should be checked every hour until specialist ophthalmological  care can be provided.Pharmacological management is the most common initial  intervention in lowering the IOP, although laser trabeculoplasty  and surgery are frequently used to slow the disease progression.Surgical treatment has no advantage over pharmacological  management in visual field protection, however surgical  interventions attain target IOP in 46% of cases compared to 35% in  those being treated medically.Several agents are available and the primary choice of drug depends  on the degree of pressure lowering which needs to be achieved.It  is recommended to initiate treatment on one type of medication.If an inadequate response in lowering the IOP is observed, the  dose may be adjusted, or a second agent may be added.If the  first agent fails to demonstrate any measureable clinical response,  it should be removed from the regimen and be replaced with an  alternative drug.Pharmacological agents used to lower the IOP  include prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,  α  adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, β blockers and  hyperosmotic agents.Adequate treatment of glaucoma requires  a high level of adherence.It is estimated that 45% of patients will  default on chronic treatment, if they are not appropriately followed  up and counselled regarding dosage instructions and possible side  effects.Table 2 below summarises the currently available drugs in  South Africa used to lower intraocular pressure.Latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost are prostaglandin   F agonists, which increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous  humour.It is considered the most potent group of topical ocular  hypotensive agents currently available and may lower baseline IOP  by 25–35%.There are few associated systemic side effects and  mostly relates to headaches.In addition, latanoprost may cause  joint/muscle pain and flu-like symptoms.Local adverse effects  include blurred vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye discomfort,  permanent iridial pigmentation, macular edema and thickening of  the eyelashes.Acetazolamide, dorzolamide and brinzolamide are sulphonamide  derivatives  which  reduces  aqueous  humour  production  independent to its diuretic mode of action.Acetazolamide is  administered systemically in the form of oral tablets or intravenous  infusion, and additionally reduces the rate of aqueous inflow up to  50%.Its usefulness is limited to the management of acute closed  angle glaucoma due to unfavourable systemic side effects which  may include paresthesia, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and  dose related systemic acidosis.Topical application of dorzolamide  and brinzolamide demonstrates an improvement in ocular blood  flow and long-term preservation of visual field.An average reduction  of  15–20% in baseline IOP can be expected.Side effects include  ocular irritation, dry eyes, blurred vision, eyelid inflammation and a  bitter taste.Brimonidine is a selective α2 receptor agonist.It initially reduces  aqueous humour production followed by a subsequent increase  in the uveoscleral outflow, therefore proving to be useful in  preventing a rise in IOP prior to anterior segment laser surgery.Brimonidine reduces baseline IOP with approximately 20%.Apraclonidine reduces the formation of aqueous humour but has  no effect on the facilitation of outflow.It has affinity for both α1  and α2 adreno-receptors and are used to prevent postsurgical  elevation of IOP after anterior segment laser therapy.Apraclonidine  reduces baseline IOP by 30% and is additionally used as adjuvant  therapy in resistant cases of glaucoma.Systemic side effects of the  alpha agonists are related to the central nervous system (headache,  fatigue, insomnia, depression) and respiratory system.Caution  should be taken in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency,  postural hypotension and renal or hepatic failure.Hypersensitivity  reactions, ocular irritation, eyelid edema, foreign body sensation  and dry eyes are common with topical use.Pilocarpine is the only available cholinergic agent in the  management of acute closed-angle glaucoma registered in South  Africa.Administration results in the increase in aqueous humour  outflow by contraction of the ciliary muscle and constriction of the  pupil.Poorly tolerated side effects, such as ciliary muscle spasm,  myopia and decreased vision limits its usefulness.Although prostaglandin receptor agonists are the most potent  agents in reducing the IOP, beta blockers are regarded as the first  choice in treating open angle glaucoma.Individual agents differ in  their ability to lower IOP, with betaxolol achieving a 15% decrease,  compared to 20–25% with timolol and levobunolol respectively.Betaxolol is, however, more cardioselective (β1) and therefore has  fewer pulmonary side effects compared to timolol and levobunolol  (which are non-selective antagonists on β1 and β2 receptors).The  mechanism involves a reduction of aqueous humour production  and does not cause miosis or accommodation disturbances  compared to cholinergic agents.The most common adverse effects  are ocular irritation and dry eyes.All the β blockers (including the  cardioselective agents) are contraindicated in patients with asthma,  COPD and bradycardia, unless alternative treatment is unavailable.Several combination agents are available in the treatment of  glaucoma.Most of these combinations include timolol, since  β blockers are still considered first line therapy in open-angle  glaucoma and ocular hypertension.Fixed-dose combination  therapy is more efficacious than its individual components, but still  less efficacious than its respective unfixed combinations.It provides  for simplified treatment regimes and enhances compliance.Fixed  dose combinations containing prostaglandins have a lower risk  in causing hyperemia.Combination of timolol with dorzolamide  is superior in visual field preservation compared to timolol and  brinzolamide.Combination preparations with brimonidine  have less visual disturbances, taste alterations and ocular allergic  reactions compared to the single ingredient product.With the recent attention cannabis has been receiving in the  management of pain and other cancer related conditions, it  is important to remember the favourable effect of its active  ingredient, Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in reducing ocular  blood flow.Studies from the 1970s have reported a 30% reduction  in the IOP by inhalation or intravenous administration of THC.The  use is, however, limited owing to the cardiovascular (increased heart  rate and decreased blood pressure) and neurological (tolerance  and addiction) side effects.Topical application does not produce  a significant clinical effect.The use of synthetic cannabinoids may  provide a basis for potential future treatment strategies.General practitioners and family physicians play an important  role in the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with  suspected glaucoma.Fundoscopic examinations are quick and  easy to perform and are an opportunity that present at each  consultation.The early recognition of symptoms may improve  outcomes and delay progression.Taking a good medical history  and applying the principles of rational drug use may identify  potential pharmacological causes for glaucoma.Practitioners  prescribing any of the drugs known to cause acute angle glaucoma  should be vigilant in patients presenting with characteristic signs  or symptoms, and immediately refer them to an ophthalmologist.Patients need to be counselled on the associated adverse effects  from glaucoma medication in order to improve adherence.'"
